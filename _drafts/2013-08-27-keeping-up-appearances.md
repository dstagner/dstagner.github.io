title: Keeping up appearances - real vs perceived risk
---
The appearance of risk is more important than actual risk.

Risk is about danger. Fear is about perception of danger. What is called "risk management" in business should probably be called "fear management" instead. 

When the interest is actually in reducing risk, they prefer ITIL and other rigid, process-driven methodologies that look strong. To use an analogy from the [DevOpsGuys blog](http://blog.devopsguys.com/2013/07/17/devops-antifragility-and-the-borg-collective/), ITIL is a castle and DevOps is a Borg. To a simple thought process, the castle obviously looks stronger, and thus less risky. But castles are only good at defending against castle kinds of problems. They’re inward-facing, and vulnerable to black swan events. Their strength is also their weakness. The Borg doesn’t look so tough, because it consists of just a bunch of weak individual parts that can fail. But the Borg is outward-facing, constantly absorbing new technologies and organizations into the collective.
