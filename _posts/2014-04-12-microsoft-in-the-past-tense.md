Today, I refered to {{ 'Microsoft' | link_to: 'http://www.microsoft.com' }} in the past tense. I didn't even think consciously about it. I just did it. I don't even remember the exact sentence now. I just realize I had described Microsoft as if they no longer exist. 

### A sorry fate
Of course, Microsoft isn't dead, not yet. I will declare it dead the day it is bought by some other company, to squeeze a few remaining bucks out of what's left of its monopolies and existing product line. At that point, any pretense of innovation will cease, because there are no turnaround artists that can turn Microsoft around. And I think it's just a matter of time before it's absorbed by another entity - either a giant like Google or Facebook or some yet-to-be industry giant we haven't heard of yet, or some sort of large specialized financial parasite holding company. Either way, being bought would be the true death of what was once the most valuable company in the world. 

You might not agree with where I draw the line, or accept that it will (or can) happen. But consider the possibility. 

### What went wrong
Since the beginning, Microsoft has been driven by monopoly behavior. They dominate a market, then use that to gain monopolistic dominance in other markets, often by crushing competition. 

It started going south with the arrival of the Netscape browser and the start of the modern Internet. Browsers and websites were an outside threat. Microsoft, unable to simply prohibit browsers, was forced to compete with their own browser - sabotaging standards and trying to prevent any chance of Netscape being a default installation or a default choice. This ultimately failed, in part because Internet Explorer was inferior technology compared to Netscape (and later, Mozilla, Firefox, and Chrome). 

But browsers alone didn't hurt Microsoft's core Windows and Office monopolies.
