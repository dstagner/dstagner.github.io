### Day 1

At this moment, I'm on a road trip from Minneapolis to Indianapolis with my friend John Kentner. We are going to GenCon, the largest gaming convention in the world, to work on [Dragons in the Basement](http://dragonsinthebasement.com), a documentary film about the history and cultural impact of roleplaying games. John is meeting with the producers of another documentary ([Dungeons & Dragons: A Documentary](http://dndadoc.com)), reconnecting with people who were interviewed for his movie, and maybe shooting some new footage. Me? I'm his wingman. 

<!-- more -->

*Dragons in the Basement* started in 2000, when John partnered with Dave Arneson, one of the creators of Dungeons and Dragons, to make a documentary about the history of RPGs. Over the next two years, they shot extensive interview footage with key figures in the industry, including long interviews with Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. A rough cut was edited together and screened for a number of people in the industry. For various reasons, the project was shelved, and it became something of an urban legend in gaming circles. Gary Gygax died in 2008. Then Dave Arneson passed away in 2009, and it seemed like the movie might never be released. 

But legends don't die easily! Interest in the footage continued to grow, as did community interest in documenting Dungeons and Dragons, and RPGs in general. Many friends (including me) encouraged John to continue with the project. This summer, he finally committed himself to it, and *Dragons in the Basement* was reborn. 

### Day 2

It's thursday, the first day of GenCon. I don't have any particular need to be at GenCon today, so I dropped John off at the con, and I returned to the B&B where we're staying to work on [Congruence](http://congruence.io). I spent the afternoon playing some sort of virtual machine [Inception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception), trying to get Docker container apps running inside Vagrant inside VirtualBox on my Mac (yes, I have very nearly rational reasons for this). 

Around 9:30, I picked John up. He'd had a good day, meeting useful people and paving the way for more footage to be shot, particularly around the rise of internet-based RPGs. I picked up some scotch at a liquor store on the way to the B&B, to celebrate whatever victories we have. 

### Day 3

Today, I actually came to GenCon myself! No gaming for me, though... I'm sitting with a computer, hacking away, greeting occasional friends as they pass by my spot in a hallway lounge. John's doing his thing. I'm meeting some friends from California for dinner, and going to a concert by my friend [Mikey Mason](http://www.mikeymason.com/), and hopefully talking to him afterward about including his music in the movie. His [*Best Game Ever*](http://mikeymason.bandcamp.com/track/best-game-ever) is like the *Stairway to Heaven* of gaming songs. 

We spotted [Wil Wheaton](http://wilwheaton.net/) walking by earlier. As tempting as is was to go grab him and babble about what we're doing... I suspect we'll be seeing him tomorrow night at a screening for a clip from *Dungeons & Dragons: A Documentary* tomorrow night, as he was instrumental in the success of their Kickstarter campaign. He'll know who we are soon enough. :)

### Day 4

Saturday has been a big day for us! We went to the screening of a 10 minute clip from *D&D: A Documentary*, that included an excerpt of the Dave Arneson footage from *Dragons in the Basement*, with proper credits. Afterward, they warmly introduced John and our project, and referred back to it several times during their Q&A. We met new friends like [Jon Peterson](http://www.unreason.com/), the author of the D&D history book [Playing at the World](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615642047/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0615642047&linkCode=as2&tag=playattheworl-20), met up with old friends, and got lots of useful information and interest. 

We are *incredibly* excited about *D&D: a documentary*! The preview was beautifully shot and constructed, offering a different but equally valuable perspective on the same subject. We can hardly wait to see the finished film! 

Tomorrow morning, we're meeting again with Anthony and Cecily to talk about how we can help each other and our respective documentaries. But tonight, we are very tired and going to bed!

### Day 5

We packed up our stuff, said goodbye to our B&B host, and headed down for a last few hours at GenCon. First on the agenda was brunch with Anthony and Cecily. It was, as we hoped, a very kumbaya experience all around. We're all excited about both projects, and we could feel each other's pain as low-budget documentary producers in ways that outsiders really can't get. We have at least agreements in intent to promote each others' films, make a mutually beneficial deal so they have access to John's precious Dave Arneson footage, and otherwise help each other as much as possible. We all realize how important this work is culturally, how vital it is to preserve and clarify the history of D&D and roleplaying games. The movies offer different perspectives on the same basic subject. It's so rich and broad that there could be many more documentaries by other filmmakers, and we still wouldn't exhaust it all! 

They had to head off for another meeting, so we went to the con some more. John went to talk to various people, while I sat down for a couple of hours of hacking away on my Congruence code. When he returned, he was very pleased with his conversations - not the people he planned to talk to, but high-value surprise encounters. He reconnected with Mike Stackpole (author, game designer, and friend of Dave Arneson) and Greg Stafford (game designer and founder of Chaosium), both of whom were interviewed for *Dragons in the Basement* back during original filming, and appear in the rough cut. They are very pleased and excited to see the film finally coming to fruition. He also had good conversations with other people who can really help develop and promote the project. 

We finally headed for home, exhausted but happy. I've been friends with John for many years, but I've never seen him lit up like this. Everything went right this weekend - better than we expected, better than we even hoped. The only thing that might have made it better would be if we had an angel investor write us a $10,000 check for production expenses (and if you want to invest a few thousand in this before we turn to Kickstarter, let me know! Some early investment could help us prepare more effectively for the Kickstarter). 

I can't begin to describe how happy I am to be involved in this project! It's a vital document of a culture that was very important to me. I'm not really a gamer anymore, and can't really remember the last time I played D&D or other RPGs. But through my formative teenage years, RPGs provided structure in my life. Gaming gave me a way to create, a collection of smart and imaginative friends, and happy memories that have lasted to this day. Helping bring *Dragons in the Basement* to life is my way of giving back to a community that has given so much to me.
