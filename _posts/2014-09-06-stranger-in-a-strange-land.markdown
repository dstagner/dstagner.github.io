In late October, I will be taking an extended business trip to Silicon Valley and San Francisco, to promote Congruence. I'll be there two to three weeks, couch-surfing with various friends and trying to meet as many interesting people as possible. <!-- more -->I'll demo for anyone willing to sit still and listen to it. Hopefully, I can net some new customers and get some investor interest. Ostensibly, I'm there for the [DevOps Enterprise Summit](http://devopsenterprise.io/) on Oct. 21-23, but I'll be staying through at least the end of October. 

In my previous life as an enterprise programmer, I rarely had opportunities to travel for business, especially to the Bay area. Only once did an employer pay to send me there. I've been there a few times, but it was to visit friends and vacation, not for business. But now, as a part of the software startup community, I'm excited to see it in a whole new way.
