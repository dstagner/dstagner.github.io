"GMO fetishists". 

The phrase rolled out from my typing fingers without really consulting my conscious mind first, as my more clever witticisms often do. It was in a heated debate about GMOs at Hacker News, where I was getting downvoted for being insufficiently supportive of GMO crops. 

Amused by this, I started another thread about the phrase itself, this time on Facebook. While there, my fingers made up another witticism - "nerd boner". A nerd boner is when someone gets so excited about a new technology that it makes them irrational - the way a regular boner makes men irrational. 

![DO NOT EAT SCIENCE WORDS](http://i.imgur.com/m5ZBg7a.png)

GMO is a perfect political hot-button topic - almost immune to rational discussion. It's dominated by two core positions, both of which have serious intellectual shortcomings. One is what I call "DON'T EAT THE SCIENCE WORDS!", a sort of neo-Luddite fear of technology. The fear is that GMO itself is somehow unhealthy, that genetically modified food will cause cancer, autism, or other diseases of modernism. The other is the nerd boner - the idea that GMO is awesome, caused by straight-up technofetishism. The technofetishists love the hard science angle, so they start imagining problems they think GMO will solve, like world hunger. 

It's hard to say which side irritates me more. On one side, we have people rejecting science without understanding it. On the other hand, we have people worshipping science without thinking through the implications. 

### But Luddites are a well-understood and well-documented problem. I'm here to talk about the nerd boner. 

*I love science*. I love science the way a kid who saw moon landings when he was five loves science. I love science the way a kid who wiggled rabbit ears on a black and white tv to watch Star Trek reruns loves science, the way a kid who saw Star Wars in the theater when he was 12 loves science. It's in my heart as well as my mind. I've watched scientific advances save lives and improve the lot of the vast majority of humanity for my entire life. I deeply believe in science. 

But I don't love GMO. 

My love of science, and my practice of engineering, has taught me some basic things. First, *make sure you're asking the right questions*. Second, *don't fall in love with an answer*. If you fall in love with an answer, you stop looking closely at the questions, for unspoken fear that they will cast a shadow on your beloved answer. 

And a third thing - whenever humans or human organizations (corporations, governments, etc) are involved, ask yourself hard - *What are they trying to accomplish*? People don't do things without a reason, except maybe watching Glee. So when I see Monsanto inventing new GMO crops, I have to ask, "Why are they doing this?" To solve world hunger? Probably not. Monsanto is in the money-making business. They need to get new customers, reduce churn, and increase prices. Farmers who might be involved in such purchases are already locked into race-to-the-bottom price wars. Anything that squeezes out some more yield is a win. That doesn't mean it solves social problems. 

The argument I hear in favor of GMO, over and over, is *people are hungry*. We need GMO to feed the hungry. So this breaks into two questions. First, is hunger caused by inadequate production? And second, will GMO solve the production problem in a way that will feed the hungry? 

Hunger is more likely a product of inadequate distribution than inadequate production. When people are starving, it's usually because someone wants them to starve - someone with a lot of guns and a willingness to use them on anyone who tries to get food to the hungry. Famine and War, those two horsemen of the Apocalypse, ride together. The world would gladly and easily give charity to help the starving, were it not for the soldiers preventing them from doing so. GMO, for all its wonders, has not found a way around guns yet. 

To the extent that hunger is due to crop failures or other production problems, this implies that the local economy is still reliant on subsistence farming rather than cash crops and full integration into the global economy. People doing subsistence don't have money, or they wouldn't be on a subsistence economy. So they're not a potential profit center. They're saving their own seeds, not buying them from Monsanto. GMO is predicated on participation in Green Revolution agriculture, selling crops as raw material in the global economy rather than eating what you grow. If the local economy isn't there yet, then mechanization, fertilizer, and other early Green Revolution techniques will raise yields more than GMO will. 

### Diversity matters

![What growing up in Central Illinois looked like](http://cf.collectorsweekly.com/stories/6SpZkCzTGamUht6.PrMNjw-small.jpg)

One of the things that worries me about modern farming, and the modern world in general, is the drastic and accelerating loss of biodiversity. The spread of commercial hybrid seed, which *is* more efficient than heirloom varieties, has pushed aside diversity of our crops. Growing up in central Illinois, I'd see mile after mile of cornfields with "Funk's G Hybrid". There were others, but that uniformity struck me, even then. Yes, I know GMO and hybrid aren't the same thing (unless it's rhetorically convenient to argue that "We've been doing GMO for thousands of years"), but my point is about diversity. Where were the other kinds of corn? What happens when a disease or environmental shift makes the singular, dominant version unviable? 

Our CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) farm raises heritage turkeys. Probably every turkey you've ever tasted - is the same breed, the Broad Breasted White. There are some 200,000,000 turkeys farmed every year, of which 25,000 are heritage breeds. Broad Breasted Whites are so hyper-focused that they can't even breed. They require artificial insemination. Without farming, they'd be extinct in a generation. But heritage breeds? The CSA charges twice as much for them, because they're actually twice as expensive to raise. They eat more food and don't put on the same weight. It's a shame, because they're an amazing food experience, fundamentally different from other turkey. 

Lack of diversity in our crops puts more focused stress on the soil. It exposes us more strongly to focused diseases. And it's boring. Maybe that last one bugs me the most, but shouldn't food be about more than sustenance? Isn't there more to what we eat than making as much food as possible, as cheaply as possible? 

### Factory farming and alienation
We don't cook anymore. We eat factory products. Most "cooking" is little more than reheating. Shelf stability and convenience have taken over, because we don't take time to cook together. We don't take time to eat together. We can't afford it. Nuke something for three minutes and eat it while staring into our screens, not talking to our families. Yeah, this is rant. Sue me. But factory farming is doing more damage to both our health and our "family values" than anything the family values people complain about. Food isn't grown to be eaten anymore. It's grown to be processed. GMO is just an extension of that. And this is why GMO won't fix hunger. It's all about making feedstock for the factory. 

### But what about that nerd boner?
![The Trouble with Tribbles](http://moodle.kentisd.net/pluginfile.php/65999/mod_book/chapter/2348/tribbles.jpg)
I've gone far off track here. What I guess I'm saying is this... there's no reason to promote GMO in the name of human culture and human decency. It won't help the hungry, because it's not for feeding the hungry. And cheaper, more factory-driven food just adds to the alienation of the affluent. Why would anyone want this? It's just more dehumanization. 

We want it because we've learned to love technology for the sake of technology. For those of us with an old-school science fiction childhood, technology gives us the Star Trek universe, a world where we aren't solving stupid trivial problems like hunger and poverty. We believe in our bones that science will save us. We look around, and see a world still suffering from hunger. GMO is a product that makes more food. Therefore, it'll solve hunger, right? Well, not really, because hunger isn't caused by a lack of crops, not anymore. Yet it's easier to cheer on GMO than it is to tackle the other Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
