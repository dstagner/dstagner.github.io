Nice, thank you. Stay classy. Well, I'll tell you one thing. Your Hardy Boys routine is over. No more asking him to drive you on stakeouts. It's too dangerous, you hear me?

Chemotherapy and marijuana go together like apple pie and Chevrolet. Facing death changes a person, it has to, don't you think? You can do this, Hank. Come on. It's supposed to hurt. Pain is weakness leaving your body. Hey, if you could get your leg up that high, I say go for it.

Don't get me wrong. I think it's just great that he's, y'know, back and he's feeling better. I just, I mean, he...naked. He was naked naked in a supermarket. It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

These shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person â€” then take the bus home to my 16 cats.

You know I hate that. Dave said I should express that.
