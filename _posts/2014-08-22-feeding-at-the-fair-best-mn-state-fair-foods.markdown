Minnesota has the best state fair in America, which means the best fair of its kind in the world. For countless Minnesotans, it's an annual pilgrimage, a family tradition. And for most of us, one of the key reasons is *the food*. The State Fair is the source of more delicious and unique food experiences than any one person could possibly eat. We build up favorites over the years, though. Here are some of mine... 

1. **Pickle Dogs** - By my own standards, these are not good fair food. They're nothing more than a pickle spear (with optional jalapenos) rolled up in a slice of pastrami smeared with cream cheese. This isn't the food of a finely tuned assembly line that would be impossible to perfect even in restaurant conditions. It's not part of some unique ethnic culinary tradition, or  No, this is something some stoner would slap together after digging through the fridge for a munchies cure. But it's cool, salty, and refreshing, and more protein/veggie than fat and carbs. Most fair food is either cold-and-sweet or hot-and-salty, and most of it is heavy and full of either flour or sugar. 
1. **Corn Dogs** - I don't have a favorite to recommend here. My two go-tos are Pancho Dogs and Pronto Pups. This year, I had a Pancho Dog, and I observed that the breading seems better for Pancho Dogs, but the hot dog itself is better at Pronto Pups. 
1. **Harry Singh's Carribean Doubles** - Doubles are curried chickpeas sandwiched between two pieces of a sort of eggy frybread. Harry Singh's Carribean is one of my favorite restaurants in the Twin Cities (hell, in the world), but these aren't on his usual restaurant menu. Get 'em with the hot sauce, if you dare. And if you like hotter than that, get the jerk chicken roti instead. It will *hurt your face*. Harry Singh's food is a fascinating reinterpretation of Indian food via Trinidad, so if you love Indian and aren't afraid of a few chilis, it's a must-try. 
1. **About a Foot Long Hot Dogs** - These are the best-tasting hot dogs I've ever had. Just a dog and some fried onions. Add a little mustard. Perfection. They're always a treat either before or after visiting the Fine Art exhibit. 
1. **Craft beer flights** - For the past few years, the Minnesota Craft Brewers Association has had a section in the Agriculture building where you can get flights of Minnesota-made beers. Eight bucks gets you four small pours of various brews, and there are a bunch of different kinds of flights, each showcasing a different style - Belgians, dark beers, hoppy, etc. The selections rotate constantly as new kegs are added, so it's always a surprise. Great way to discover new beers!
