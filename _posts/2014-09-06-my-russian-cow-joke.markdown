A Russian was angry that his neighbor had a cow and he didn't. So he appealed to authority (either God or the Communist Party, depending on the era of the joke) and demanded justice. ${AUTHORITY} said, "You're right, this is unjust, and I will fix it." The Russian responded, "So you're going to kill my neighbor's cow?"

Not really my joke. I picked it up somewhere, somewhen, don't remember now. But I'm the only person I ever hear telling it.

Back in the day, I thought of this joke as a comment on Russian character, of the dark and pessimistic attitude I thought of as Russian. But today, I see it differently, as a comment on the broader human condition.

Leaving the world of employment for the challenges of starting my own business has caused me to think deeply about where wealth comes from, and how to actually get financially rich, as opposed to making a salary. It's also introduced me to the world of wealthy people, a world that had been largely unfamiliar to me before. Filtering out inherited wealth, how do people start poor/middle class and become wealthy?

This comes back to the Russian cow joke. I think that most people believe the only way to get rich is to take the money from someone who is already rich, and that people who are rich got rich by taking their wealth from the poor. (This ignores the alternative path of wealth simply falling from the sky in the form of lottery tickets, inheriting from an unknown relative, etc.) And this is why most people will never, ever get rich.

In reality, most of the self-made rich people got rich by creating new value. They created something that didn't exist before, and a way to keep on creating it, and a way to sell it. They found a need in the world and fulfilled it. They literally made money.

A good business doesn't make the owner rich by stealing from others. Quite the opposite - a good business makes the owner rich by making others richer. If buying your product for $1 helps me sell my product for $2, then you've made me richer, not poorer!

Now, extend the concept of "wealth" to non-financial realms, and this idea becomes even better. Can you sell me a product that gives me wonderful memories? If so, then it makes me richer. That trip to Paris? Richer. It's all about creating something that didn't exist before, something that has value, even if it's not cash value.

Treating wealth as a zero-sum game, where one person can get richer only by making another person poorer, is a losing idea. The sooner you leave it behind, the sooner you can make real progress.
