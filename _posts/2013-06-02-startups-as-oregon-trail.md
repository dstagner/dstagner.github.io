The Oregon Trail (the real-world entity, not the game) was a primary route for settling the Old West. Early trailblazers, from Lewis and Clark onward, found passages across the Rocky Mountains and other hazards. But as more and more traveled the route, it transitioned from being an unknown and dangerous task to a well-known and dangerous task.


### Advancing technology changes the nature of startups

As the Oregon Trail grew, towns popped up along the trail, profiting from the immigrants passing through. Ferries and other aids came along too, making particularly dangerous parts safer. Expert guides offered their services in turn for money – some valuable, some not so valuable. The Oregon Trail become, if not safe, at least a relatively predictable and well-understood exercise.

And it was something you only did once, if you had any sense.

Paul Graham and Y Combinator have created a template for the software startup Oregon Trail… guides to solve difficult problems (finding co-founders, meeting investors), advertisement and communication, etc. And lots of other startup incubators and support businesses are following in Y Combinator’s model. It’s becoming civilized, less dangerous (but still dangerous).

What’s the point of this? I don’t know, except that it seemed like a good analogy when I woke up this morning.
