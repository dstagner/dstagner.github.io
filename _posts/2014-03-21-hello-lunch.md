# Hello lunch!
## Or, how I learned to stop worrying and fear the dice.

Back in high school, I was in a D&D group. We encountered a horse, the DM
rolled the horse's reaction to us. Our druid spoke to the horse, and the
horse said, "Hello lunch!"

That's what a natural one will do.

Since then, I've always used "Hello lunch!" in place of "Hello world!" when
programming.
