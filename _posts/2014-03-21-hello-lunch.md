Back in high school, I was in a D&D group. We encountered a horse, the DM rolled the horse's reaction to us. Our druid spoke to the horse, and the
horse said, "Hello lunch!"

That's what a natural one will do.

Since then, I've always used "Hello lunch!" in place of "Hello world!" when programming. I don't really game anymore, but I learned lots of useful lessons about software from my old high school and college gaming days. They often come to mind when I encounter a difficult problem. 

### "We kill it and go on. What happens next?"

This one was from a session some friends (not me) had. The DM kept sending weak, easily defeated monsters. After a while, when the players encountered such an opponent, one player just said, "We kill it and go on. What happens next?" This was a funny, so the players kept saying it as they encountered more things. 

Until they encountered something big, something at the edge of their abilities.

"We kill it and go on. What happens next?"

I try to take that attitude with everything. We all should. 

### What you don't know you know. 

I was briefly in a gaming group with an engineer, working at a rather important scientific lab. One day at gaming, he told us a work story. He was trying to figure out a rig to hold a piece of equipment in place. Then *he had an idea*. He rushed to his drafting table (this was a long time ago), and drew his beautiful idea. It was brilliant! He'd patent it and get rich! When his drawing was finished, he proudly unveiled it to a colleague, who said...

"Mike, you've just invented the C clamp."

It's a lesson taken to heart. Whenever I'm trying to solve a problem, I try to make sure that I don't invent the C-clamp... fighting for a brilliant solution that turns out to be something I knew all along, blinded by my own obsession.
