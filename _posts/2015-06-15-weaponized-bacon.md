This is a story of a recipe, and also of cultures coming together. 

At the [Convergence](http://convergence-con.org) science fiction convention, there is a room party called the House of Toast. For three nights, House of Toast provides toast with toppings to the thousands of hungry geeks swarming the convention. In 2015, the theme of the con was "Dystopia". The House of Toast went along with it, calling themselves "Dystoastia" that year. My daughter and I decided to make a variety of toppings for Dystoastia, based on the them. 

One of them was Weaponized Bacon. 

### The recipe

Bacon powder is a simple molecular gastronomy trick. The key ingredients are rendered bacon fat and maltodextrin. 

Maltodextrin dissolves instantly in water - and I do mean *instantly*. You need to be certain all work surfaces and tools are absolutely clean and try before you ever touch the stuff, and until you're done with it. For tasting, get out several spoons in advance, and only use each one once for tasting. 

So, the recipe... put about a cup of maltodextrin in a food processor. Put the lid on, and start it going. A fine smoke-like powder will come from the feed like a chimney. Into the feed, add about one to two tablespoons of bacon fat, very slowly, a drop at a time. Let it incorporate. When you think it's starting to get there, stop and taste. Add more bacon fat if needed, but too much and it will start to clump and lose its magical fluffy texture (if it does, add more maltodextrin and keep incorporating). What you get should be a pure white powder, similar in appearance to flour (or cocaine, if you think like that), that tastes like bacon. Very easy!

To really get the flavor to pop, you might want to add a little fine salt as well. Be very careful with this, though... there's not much bacon fat in there, and the salt can easily overwhelm it. 

### Finding the right bacon

To really make the bacon powder sing, it needs the right bacon. We tried two. The first was [Benton's bacon](http://shop.bentonscountryham.com/). It has considerable fame, thanks to "Mind of a Chef". It's deeply smoky and powerful. 

The second bacon we tried was small ends of slab bacon, smoked in-house at [Finer Meat](http://www.finermeatco.com/) in Minneapolis. We wandered in there on a whim the other day and were immediately struck by the delicious smell of their smoked meats. We bought some bacon, and a turkey wing. If the turkey wing is half as good as the bacon was, we'll be back.

And the winner? Finer Meat. It smelled better, tasted better, and looked better. The slab bacon, really meant for rendering fat, produced a clear, clean fat that tasted spectacular. It wasn't as smoky as the legendary Benton's, but it made up for it with a rich, porky goodness. 

### Variations

*Nuclear Bacon* - Weaponized bacon with chili peppers. We used a combination of chipotle and Chinese peppers. 

*Breakfast Bacon* - Weaponized bacon with coffee. 

### A meeting of cultures

Bacon powder is a straightforward expression of the [_molecular gastronomy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_gastronomy) movement in modern cuisine. Making powders from fats and maltodextrin originated in industrial foods (think of the cheese powder on a Cheeto). Science fiction has a grand tradition of applying hi-tech fantasy to foods. And love of bacon is so deep, it practically has its own fandom. 

People were *excited*. Weaponized bacon was a hit! The name, the concept, and the audience all came together. People who would never visit an exotic or experimental restaurant were lined up to try it. It spoke to them.
