Why do we buy lottery tickets? To get rich? Of course not. The chance is almost nonexist. No, the reason we buy lottery tickets is to *fantasize* about getting rich. When we play the lottery, we get to imagine a chance, however small, to imagine owning a mansion, lounging on the beach, driving a Ferrari, stuff like that. 

So why do we buy a gun to defend our home?
