# About me...

I'm Dave Stagner. I founded a dinky little early-stage startup called [Congruence](https://www.congruence.io), with a modest plan to completely reimagine how developers and operations work together, by modeling change across the entire system. Like any sofware system, the text of this page will continuously evolve to suit the needs of the moment. 

Before founding Congruence, I put in a couple of decades in the software industry, mostly doing enterprise configuration management and systems programming. I like the Big Picture, and seeing how all the small pieces come together to create a whole. 

Music is also a great passion for me. I play guitar and numerous other instruments, have produced several albums, and am a member of two ongoing bands as well as some impossible-to-count number of oddball side projects.
