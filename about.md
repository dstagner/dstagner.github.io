# About me

I'm Dave Stagner. I do a lot of things. First and foremost, I'm the founder of [Congruence]({{ http://congruence.io }}). Someday, Congruence will put a real dent in the amount of suck involved in working on complex software projects. But for now, it's a sprouted seed, still forcing its way through the dirt toward its faith in the Sun. 

Before Congruence, I worked in enterprise systems programming and configuration management for 20+ years. That's where I found out about the suck I want to fix. I didn't set out to be a startup founder. I just kept encountering the same problems everywhere I worked, and complained that no one made software to solve it. Then I said to myself, "Hey, why don't you solve it yourself?"

Besides Congruence, I'm an artist. My primary medium is music. I've played guitar for thirty-odd years now, and am currently in two main bands and some uncountable number of intermittent side projects. Playing music is essential for my mental health. If I don't play regularly, I become sad and irritable. 

You can follow me on [Twitter]({{ https://twitter.com/davestagner }}), or email me at dave@congruence.io. I'm always happy to meet new people!
