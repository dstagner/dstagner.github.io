I presented this Ignite talk at [DevOpsDays Minneapolis 2014](http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-minneapolis/). It seems to have developed a life of its own on Slideshare! Here's the slides...

This was (obviously) inspired by [Stephen Covey's](https://www.stephencovey.com/) classic book, [**The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People**](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B00GOZV3TM/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1407702953&sr=1-1&keywords=seven+habits+of+highly+effective+people). I'm a firm believer in reading the classic works of any given field. **Seven Habits** has sold over 15 million copies, and probably at least a million of them have actually been read, so it's a bona fide classic. And it's superb advice too.
