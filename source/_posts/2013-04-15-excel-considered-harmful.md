I’m coming to the conclusion that Microsoft Excel is the most toxic piece of software in the IT industry. Here’s a few reasons why…

1. It is used as a faux-database to store data that will be consumed by computers, but generally not in a computer-consumable way. This leads to duplication and inconsistency. 

2. It is a two-dimensional representation only, but gets used to represent relational data, usually in a very awkward manner.

3. Spreadsheets get emailed around and updated by different people, resulting in out-of-sync versions and confusion.

Sure, csv export blah blah, SharePoint woof woof. Anyone sophisticated enough to handle spreadsheets as data stores responsibly is sophisticated enough to use a real database.
