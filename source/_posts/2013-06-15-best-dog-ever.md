### Rubucac, 2003-2013

He was the best dog ever. In Plato’s noumenal world, there is an ideal essence of dogness. That essential dog looks and acts like Rubucac did.

Rubucac was our first family dog. We’d bought a house, and we wanted a dog. My wife started looking at Australian shepherds online. The local Aussie rescue were, like most dog rescues, broadly interested in dogs, and were trying to save dogs from a pound in Rome, GA that puts down thousands of dogs a year. Rubu was a tiny puppy who had already been passed over once due to his adorable nature, in hopes that he would be adopted. The rescue people asked us to look, and we agreed to take this dog where we knew nothing but a picture of black fuzz on the Internet. It took two weeks to get him from Georgia to Minnesota, two weeks of obsessively looking at the picture of “CAC1630″ every day, falling in love with him. My wife named him “Rubucac”, so we could preserve that part of his heritage without sounding like a hairball. When he finally arrived in a van full of crated rescues… well, if we’d walked into a shelter with a thousand dogs, we would have picked him. He was perfect. And when we took him home, well, he was pretty much born housebroken. He was dominant without being aggressive, energetic without being exhausting, big without being awkward, and stunningly beautiful. He was the perfect dog.

One morning, four weeks ago, he wouldn’t eat breakfast. Instead, he settled into a chair and didn’t want to move. Worried, we took him to the vet. They couldn’t find anything obviously wrong with him, and asked that we bring him back in a few days. The next morning, he collapsed completely and had a seizure. We had to carry him to the car for another trip to the vet. A different vet that morning, she told us that it was “80% likely” that he had hemangiosarcoma, a deadly and incurable cancer that sometimes affects older, larger dogs. It is a cancer of the blood vessel linings that usually first appears in the spleen. By the time it is noticed (usually due to a ruptured blood vessel causing internal bleeding, leading to collapse), it has already metastasized, spreading to the lungs, the brain, or the heart. Treatment options are very limited. A splenectomy followed by chemotherapy usually results in no more than a few months more, at a terrible cost to the dog’s comfort. Now, there was an outside chance that it could be a Lyme-like tick-borne illness, so he went on antibiotics for that. We took him home to see.

After a couple of weeks, though, it was clear that it wasn’t infection. His condition gradually worsened. He would have good days, then collapse again, then recover, then more collapse – and the collapses were becoming more frequent. We decided to keep him at home until he died of natural causes. One of the few saving graces of hemangiosarcoma is its efficiency. Dogs die of internal bleeding or heart attack well before the kind of pain that cancer can bring sets in. But last weekend, he suffered a terrible, near-fatal attack again, then a short recovery, then another attack. We decided it was time to have him put to sleep.

We found a marvelous veterinarian, Dr. Karen Randall of [Solace Veterinary Hospice](http://solaceveterinaryhospice.com/). She specializes in end-of-life care for beloved pets, including at-home euthanasia. She came to our house this evening to help put Rubucac to sleep. She very patiently got to know him, and listened to our stories about him. When we were ready, she gave him a sedative, causing him to fall asleep in about ten minutes, giving us time to say our goodbyes. Then she gave him an overdose of barbituates, stopping his heart. She waited for our grieving, until we were ready to let him go completely. She then took him with her for cremation, and will return his ashes to us so they can be scattered in the yard that was his home for his entire life.

If you are a pet owner and this is ever an option for you, I highly recommend at-home euthanasia for your beloved pets when their time comes. It is hardly more expensive than a trip to the vet, and a great deal kinder. Your dear friend can die in peace, at home, in the company of family. So much better than being dragged out in the car, in pain, and going to die on a surgical table in a strange and scary-smelling room.

The question I have been asking myself all week, though… why is euthanasia for pets considered kind and decent, but euthanasia for people is murder? Frankly, if I had some horrible, inoperable cancer like Rubu did, that’s how I’d want to go – at home, while I’m still aware, with my loved ones present, at the hands of a compassionate and skilled medical professional. It would be the kindest thing, the thing I would want for myself. What’s wrong with our society, that we consider this illegal and immoral?

And finally, I have to express my admiration for those in our society who specialize in grief. Dr. Randall is not merely a vet. She has a mission. And I’ve seen that same mission in funeral home directors and ministers who comfort the living when they deal with the death of their loved ones, and in doctors who care for terminal patients. I could never, ever do that myself, and it’s an incredibly valuable service. Thank you, those of you who help us grieve.
