This blog needs a lot of work. There are things that are basically broken and need debugging, a new header image would be good, maybe a two column layout. And I need to clean out the "mad scientist" room in my basement, full of detritus from previous and current hobbies. I have friends in far-flung places I should visit. The dog's licenses need renewed. 

*I don't have sufficient bandwidth.*

I've felt this very painfully over the past couple of weeks. Right now, I'm in the throes of my startup, Congruence. I don't yet have a working product, and I no longer have a dayjob to pay the bills. Everything is riding on getting Congruence out the door, in front of customers, and cashflow positive, before I run out of money. Frankly, it's terrifying. But equally frankly, I'd rather gnaw my own leg off than go back to the world of corporate droning. But meanwhile, over the past couple of weeks in particular, other projects have taken a significant chunk of my time, enough to put me "behind schedule" in my head. 

The thing is, these aren't mere distractions. They are *bucket list* projects. Helping out with the *Dragons in the Basement* documentary? If I do enough good work on it, I'll get a producer credit. I'll be in IMDB as a movie producer. Check *that* off my bucket list! And my bandmate Beth has written the music for an album we've dreamed of doing for years, a concept album about the works of Joseph Campbell called *Hero's Journey*. Seventeen songs, one for each step in Campbell's mythology analysis. I want us to record it, and then do a Kickstarter to get a vinyl release done. A double vinyl record of progressive rock? Bucket list! So, these are things I really, really want to do. And there are other things kicking around in there too, things I love doing for people I love. I was complaining to someone about this today, and she said I have the most awesome problems ever. 

I can feel the stress. Last night, I had insomnia until 4am, and I'm afraid I'm heading there again. I have sores in my mouth that come with the stress. I'm pretty certain life as a startup founder will eventually give me an ulcer. 

But I was going to talk about latency and bandwidth. 

Being a startup founder means you are never not at work. Given the pressure, I'm all about optimizing my productivity. Something I've learned about my programming productivity over the past couple of months is that my best work is in heavy bursts, controlled death marches. If I can code 12-15 hour days three days straight, I get more done than if I put in that 36-40 hours of coding over 6 days. It's not just the hours, it's how they're done. And this comes down to latency.
