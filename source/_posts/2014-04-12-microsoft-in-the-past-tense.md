### Trying to protect two monopolies, Microsoft lost both.

Today, I refered to {{ 'Microsoft' | link_to: 'http://www.microsoft.com' }} in the past tense. I didn't even think consciously about it. I just did it. I don't even remember the exact sentence now. I just realize I had described Microsoft as if they no longer exist. 

And they did it to themselves.

### A sorry fate
Of course, Microsoft isn't dead, not yet. I will declare it dead the day it is bought by some other company, to squeeze a few remaining bucks out of what's left of its monopolies and existing product line. At that point, any pretense of innovation will cease, because there are no turnaround artists that can turn Microsoft around. And I think it's just a matter of time before it's absorbed by another entity - either a giant like Google or Facebook, or some yet-to-be industry giant we haven't heard of yet, or some sort of large financial parasite like Bain Capital. Either way, being bought will be the true death of what was once the most valuable company in the world. 

You might not agree with where I draw the line, or accept that it will (or can) happen. But consider the possibility. 

### What went wrong
Microsoft is built on two monopolies - Windows and Office. Smart phones and tablets were obviously an existential threat to both monopolies. There were three ways out. Do nothing (and lose the monopolies), try to protect one monopoly in order to save the other, or sacrifice both. 

Since the beginning, Microsoft has been driven by monopoly behavior. They dominate a market, then use that to gain monopolistic dominance in other markets, often by crushing competition with questionably legal/ethical power plays. 

It started going south with the arrival of the Netscape browser and the start of the modern Internet. Browsers and websites were an outside threat. Microsoft, unable to simply prohibit browsers, was forced to compete with their own browser - sabotaging standards and trying to prevent any chance of Netscape being a default installation or a default choice. This ultimately failed, in part because Internet Explorer was inferior technology compared to Netscape (and later, Mozilla, Firefox, and Chrome). 

But browsers alone didn't hurt Microsoft's core Windows and Office monopolies. Failure to get on to a new platform hurt those monopolies.

Tablets and smart phones have been obvious convergence points since long before they hit the market in a useful way. The modern tablet computer was first envisioned in 1972, as Alan Kay's [Dynabook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook). Attempts to actually build one have happened since the 1990s - the [Apple Newton](http://oldcomputers.net/apple-newton.html) and Microsoft's own [Tablet PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Tablet_PC) standard. But Microsoft, like so many others, couldn't get it right. 

The first successful tablet, then, wasn't a tablet at all. It was a phone, the Apple iPhone. This was in no way a viable platform for Office, and it was immune to Windows. But the iOS operating system that Apple developed served as the basis for the iPad. Apple provided consumers with a clear path and an existing body of software written for the iPhone, that could run on the iPad. Moreover, the iPad worked really well, at a good price point. The explosion of wireless networking made internet-driven media consumption available everywhere. The App Store made it easy for consumers to buy more software with just a few clicks, and provided an exciting new platform for developers. Shortly afterward, Google gave the world the Android operating system, offering the same core benefits as iOS with some tasteful differences, and open to all hardware manufacturers. The traditional PC builders could compete with Apple in this new market - but not with a Microsoft platform. 

Microsoft didn't have a tablet platform. They didn't have an OS, and they didn't have Office for iOS or Android. The threat was obvious. This is where Microsoft made their mistake - they tried to defend both monopolies at once. They could have let Windows go and saved Office, but they didn't.
